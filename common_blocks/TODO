- stabilize the constraints by replacing them by QR-based found lines
- embed properly local coarse matrices into large coarse matrix 
     - even for adaptive constraints - this is now completely wrong
- create data structures for neighbour communication and reuse the parallel PCG method from the first version of the code
- create coarse level
