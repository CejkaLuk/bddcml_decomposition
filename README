Multilevel BDDC solver library
==============================

Installation
--------------

1. Create `make.inc` within the main directory from `make.inc.example`.
Make sure that the following necessary external libraries are available:
   - BLOPEX ( http://code.google.com/p/blopex )
   - MUMPS  ( http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/MUMPS )
   - ParMETIS ( http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/parmetis/overview )
   - LAPACK ( http://www.netlib.org/lapack )
   - BLAS ( http://www.netlib.org/blas )
   - **Note**: LAPACK and BLAS are often included in numerical libraries such as [MKL](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/get-started-guide/2023-0/overview.html).

2. Run the `make` command which will:
   - compile objects and modules in the `src/` folder,
   - create a library `libbddcml.a` in `lib/` folder, and
   - compile example solvers in `examples/` solver.

The library provides a simple interface callable from Fortran and C. The solution process is
operated by several routines consequently called.

Two different modes are possible for input:
- user can either provide information about global mesh and a file with element matrices, or
- user can provide division into subdomains on the first level and pass
  subdomain matrices for each subdomain to the routine


Benchmarks
--------------

### Poisson Equation on a Cube
The benchmarks involve using scripts to run the `examples/poisson_on_cube` example for different decomposition algorithms on the GPU. The benchmark scripts create many log files
which can later be parsed for the results.

Requirements:
- `tnl_bddcml_interface` - The interface that integrates the [Decomposition project](https://gitlab.com/tnl-project/decomposition) and [TNL](https://gitlab.com/tnl-project/tnl) into BDDCML.

Execution Instructions:
1. Prepare the executable files.
2.
