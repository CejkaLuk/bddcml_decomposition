Version of BDDC solver based on MUMPS package.

BDDC solver without explicit coarse problem.
Based on MUMPS package.

structure:
bddcmumps.f90    - main program
module_bddc.f90  - routines related to BDDC preconditioner
module_sm.f90    - routines related to sparse matrices in IJA format
module_mumps.f90 - wrapper routines for using MUMPS package

For detailed description, see source files.
They should be densly commented.


Developing notes:
-----------------
Implemented matrix G with aritmetic averages.
Implemented solution via projected BDDC using sparse H.
Implemented change of variables.
Residual rotated to new coordinates - in ech iteration - PCG on ORIGINAL problem.
Implemented block inverse of matrix with averages in the change of variables.
Matrix T converted to sparse for iterations.
Differences between transformed and original problem implemented as an option.
Corrections for Stokes problem:
   - ones on diagonal after BC elimination instead of original value.
   - number of averages on face up to number of dimensions (velocities for Stokes, no pressures)
Implemented iterations with reduced problem on interface as an option.
