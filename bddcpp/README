BDDCPP
======
Preprocesor for BDDC method.

Some features:

Graph creation
--------------
Creates a graph corresponding to the mesh, where elements present nodes.

Division of mesh
----------------
Divides the mesh to the given number of domains using METIS.

Distribution of data 
--------------------
into separate files for parallel processing.

Glob selection
--------------
Classification of edges/faces/vertices due to Klawonn.
Implemented merging corners to edges.
Check of sufficient number of corners subdomain by subdomain.
Prepares global file with glob description GLB.

W_tilde creation
----------------
Prepares virtual numbering for BDDC.
Prepares distributed numbering for MUMPS_DIST.
Distributes globs to local GLB files.

Tecplot export
--------------
Exports geometry and division into subdomains to Tecplot file format.

Assembly solution
-----------------
Get global solution from subdomain files obtained by BDDCPMD.

Distribute element matrices and fixed variables and RHS
-------------------------------------------------------
For distributed solution by BDDCPMD.
